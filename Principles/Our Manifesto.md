# Our Manifesto

We aim to foster a culture of openness and transparency, collaboration and continuous development.

1. ##### Open work-spaces:
   All work-spaces will be open and accessible. However, adequate meeting rooms will be available for teams to have project-based discussions and for people to do deep work.
2. ##### Extensive communication:
   We will use all modes of communication to ensure there is adequate information and context on everything happening in the company. Space, working sessions, Office Hours, Weekly all-hands/ team meetings, and Fortnightly Open-houses (with the Ask Me Anything tool) are channels we will use extensively.
3. ##### Conversation Style:
   As a team we will indulge in positively biassed conversations with each other. Even criticisms and disagreements must be constructive and should be directly handled with the person in question. Negative comments must be avoided.
4. ##### Exposure to multiple learning opportunities:
   Every effort will be made to ensure adequate exposure and learning opportunities for individuals by allowing participation across different projects.
5. ##### Continuous feedback:
   Continuous, real-time feedback will be provided at every opportunity. Task, Event and Project based feedback will be strongly encouraged instead of time-based feedback.
6. ##### Mentorship:
   Every individual will have the option of identifying someone internally as his / her mentor who will be outside their project domain. The mentor will work closely with the person over an extended period of time to help with areas of development.
7. ##### Performance Evaluation:
   We will not have bell-curve based grading. We will follow the annual review cycle (linked to the OKR cycle) for every individual. The performance review will cover individual OKRs, behaviours/ values, feedback from peers, manager and mentor and a development plan.
8. ##### Fun times:
   We will get-together once a month with just one objective ...TO HAVE FUN! The fun sessions will be timed with the availability of the maximum number of folks.
9. ##### Celebrate all wins, big and small, learn from failures:
   We will endeavour to celebrate every success with each other. We will also openly discuss failures with reflections on what went well and what could have been better.
10. ##### Great Onboarding:
    The first 3 weeks for any employee are crucial to develop context and understanding of who we are, our culture, ways of working and ongoing engagements and projects. We will invest in ensuring every new team member gets every support in being set-up well for success.
