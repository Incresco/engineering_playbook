# Nextleap Program

## Welcome!

Since Sept 2022, **Incresco** has been running the **Nextleap mentoring programme** where we connect developers/leads with senior management team for a semi-structured and supported 12-week mentoring journey.

We launched the Project **Nextleap** mentoring programme because we believe in the power of mentorship. Whether you're a mentor or a mentee, the mentoring relationship can have numerous benefits on your professional, and even your personal, growth.&#x20;

This guide will provide you with tips and frameworks to help you make the most of your mentoring relationship.

This program is to help set you up for success as you set out on your mentoring journey. We recommend chatting about your expectations of one another, as well as your roles and responsibilities at the beginning of the relationship. When you know this, you’re defining what success looks like upfront, so you can keep moving toward it together. Here are some useful questions to consider:​

## Guidelines

### SWOT Analysis

Before the program, do a self [SWOT analysis](https://github.com/Incresco/engineering_playbook/blob/main/Nextleap/SWOT%20Analysis.md). Self analysis will help mentees and mentors to understand what needs to be worked upon during the mentorship program.

### Meeting and communicating

- **Meetings:**
  - Go through [Mentoring Session Agenda](https://github.com/Incresco/engineering_playbook/blob/main/Nextleap/Mentoring%20Session%20Agenda.md) and plan what needs to be focussed on the meetings.
  - When will you meet and how? E.g. Every Tuesday, via Zoom
  - What happens when there is an unavoidable cancellation? E.g. Inform mentoring partner at least 24 hours in advance and arrange an alternative date.
- **Communicating between meetings:**
  - How will you communicate in between meetings? E.g. Via Slack, Whatsapp Meeting prep and notes
  - When will you share meeting prep notes before the session? Who is in charge of sharing notes & action items after each meeting? (We recommend the mentee drives the agenda)

### Focus and expectations

- **Mentee focus**
  - As a mentee, what do you want to focus on in the mentoring relationship?
- **Mentor focus**
  - As the mentor, what do you want to focus on in the mentoring relationship?
- **Mentor expectations**
  - What do you expect of your mentee? (e.g. to communicate openly, be open to trying new things, provide regular feedback)
- **Mentee expectations**
  - What do you expect of your mentor? (e.g. share experience, provide regular feedback)
